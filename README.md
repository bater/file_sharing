# File sharing application

## Application setup flow:
* `git clone https://github.com/bater/file_sharing.git`
* `cd file_shareing`

## Application profile:
* Ruby 3.0.4 (2022-04-12) and Rails 6.1.6.1 (2022-07-12).
* File storage solution: ([ActiveStorage](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_storage_overview.html))
* Database

## Basic Requirements :school_satchel:
- [x] A user can upload and share files.
- [x] Two page app, one for upload and one for download.
- [x] Provide a README with clear setup instructions.
- [x] Sharing links should be hard to guess. ([nanoid](https://github.com/radeno/nanoid.rb))
- [x] Sharing links should expire.
- [ ] Have unit tests. (RSpec)

## Good to have :mortar_board:
* Build by `docker` and `docker-compse`.
* Download link should be short.
* File validation. (Max file size and filename size.)
* CI/CD.
* When file not found (expired), redirect to index with flash.
* Web Template and style.

## Bonus :fireworks:
* Anti virus.
* Feature test. (e2e testing)
* Custom download link (readable link)
* Lower cost. (File storage cost.)
* Expire time countdown js animation.
* Mobile view (RWD).
* js drop file upload.
* Copy shared link to clipboard.
* Business plan (profitable).

## What we don't do (scope out) :-1:
* User doesn't need to login.
* Doesn't need a download file list. (No file index or search funcion.)
* Live app. (by docker instead.)
